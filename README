To make CUDA, do something like:

make COMPILER=CRAY NV_ARCH=FERMI -j 6

-COMPILER is the same as with the other implementations

-NV_ARCH is the architecture - fermi or kepler only, due to things with work
 group sizes and shared storage to do with reductions.

-job number cna be however many you want, but has no effect above 22 because
 that's how many files it can process in parallel

If on a cray, add:

MPI_COMPILER=ftn C_MPI_COMPILER=cc

so it uses the cray build scripts.
